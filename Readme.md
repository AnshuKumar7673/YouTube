# YouTube

#Summary of my project :

This ambitious project represents a comprehensive backend endeavor leveraging Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, and other technologies. As we delve into the creation of a fully functional video hosting platform akin to YouTube, we encounter a myriad of essential features: user authentication through login and signup functionalities, video uploading capabilities, engagement functionalities such as liking, disliking, commenting, and replying, as well as subscription management functionalities.

Throughout the development process, we adhere to industry-standard practices, employing JWT for secure authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and implementing both access tokens and refresh tokens for enhanced security and user experience. With painstaking effort, we have meticulously crafted every aspect of this project to provide a rich learning experience, ensuring that developers can glean valuable insights into building robust backend systems.
